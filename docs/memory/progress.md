## Completion snapshot

All Workshop PR deliverables complete (Memory Bank, PRD, `.cursorignore`, `.claudeignore`). Doc audit pass complete (session 6). PR opened (2026-03-26); review follow-up fixes applied (commit `90d52b7`). Implementation work not yet started.
Status: On track

## Done

**Agentic tooling**
- [x] `.cursor/rules/` — 11 rules with "How to verify" sections (architecture, conventions, do-not-touch, memory-bank, security, 6 module-* rules)
- [x] `.cursor/skills/` — 4 skills (build-verify, codebase-explore, memory-bank-update, repomix-reference)
- [x] `.claude/rules/` + `.claude/skills/` — mirrored from `.cursor/` for Claude Code auto-discovery
- [x] `.agents/` — Cursor-compatible copies for homework/lecturer compatibility
- [ ] `.cursor/rules/testing.mdc.off` — disabled; enable when test work begins

**Memory Bank — core docs**
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — commands, monorepo structure, import rules, test thresholds, Memory Bank index; reference docs list updated with `decisionLog-archive.md`
- [x] `docs/memory/projectbrief.md` — project purpose, package hierarchy, key features
- [x] `docs/memory/techContext.md` — versions, dev commands, build system, ESLint rules, test infra
- [x] `docs/memory/systemPatterns.md` — state management layers, mutation pattern, action system, rendering pipeline (5 layers)
- [x] `docs/memory/productContext.md` — WHY/WHO/WHAT, UX intent, success signals, anti-goals, constraints
- [x] `docs/memory/activeContext.md` — session state, open questions, next steps; H1 added (MD041)
- [x] `docs/memory/progress.md` — this file; H1 added (MD041), checklist markers fixed

**Reference docs**
- [x] `docs/memory/decisionLog.md` — 6 undocumented-behavior entries (158 lines); pre-2026 entries archived
- [x] `docs/technical/decisionLog-archive.md` — 11 archived architectural + policy decisions (259 lines)
- [x] `docs/technical/architecture.md` — corrected: "Five layers" (was Four); ShapeCache description fixed (element reference key, correct value type)
- [x] `docs/technical/dev-setup.md` — corrected: H1 moved to line 1 (MD041); 3 fences tagged `text` (MD040); fork URL placeholder replaces hardcoded upstream URL
- [x] `docs/technical/prd-technical-notes.md` — extracted from PRD; known constraints, Q-1–Q-3, dependency table
- [x] `docs/technical/undocumented-behavior.md` — corrected: flushSync count (14 App.tsx, 2 ConfirmDialog.tsx, 1 UnlockPopup.tsx); mutateElement ShapeCache.delete triggers corrected (`height`, `width`, `fileId`, `points` only)
- [x] `docs/product/PRD.md` — 233 lines; 4 mandated sections added (Product Purpose, Target Audience, Key Features, Technical constraints / Non-goals)
- [x] `docs/product/domain-glossary.md` — ExcalidrawElement entry: 6 missing base fields documented with `_ExcalidrawElementBase` reference
- [x] `docs/product/launch-plan.md` — extracted from PRD; full phase gates, launch checklist, comm plan
- [x] `.cursorignore` — created in repo root (copy of `.claudeignore`); committed `ad88a75`
- [x] `.claudeignore` — committed `b842994`
- [x] Workshop PR — opened (2026-03-26); review follow-up fixes applied (commit `90d52b7`)

## In progress

- No tasks actively in progress — 2026-03-26. Next action awaits user direction on first implementation task.

---

## Not started

- [ ] First implementation task — TBD; needs user direction
- [ ] `docs/memory/progress.md` updates as implementation milestones are hit
- [ ] `docs/memory/activeContext.md` rewrite at end of each session

---

## Blocked

- No tasks blocked — 2026-03-26. Pending items in `## Not started` depend on user direction, not on a technical blocker.

---

## Discovered work

- [!] `yarn.lock` has an unstaged modification (last observed: 2026-03-26) — severity: **low** — investigate before adding dependencies; root cause not yet confirmed.
- [!] `frame.test.tsx` — frame element detection passes in browser, fails in jsdom, root cause unknown — severity: **medium** — do not attempt to fix without a reproducible root cause; avoid working around it silently.
- [!] `textWysiwyg.test.tsx:335` — arrow label version-bump test is non-deterministically flaky, acknowledged in code with no known cause — severity: **low** — do not mark as fixed without a reproducible root cause.
- [!] `isSomeElementSelected` in `packages/element/src/selection.ts` uses module-level memoization shared across all `Scene` instances — severity: **medium** — breaks multi-editor setups; marked as FIXME but no fix is in progress.
- [!] Theme detection in `packages/excalidraw/wysiwyg/textWysiwyg.tsx:964` uses `onChangeEmitter` watching elements instead of a dedicated Store theme emitter — severity: **low** — pending Store refactor, acknowledged with FIXME.
- [!] `UIOptions` normalization inside `Excalidraw` component (`packages/excalidraw/index.tsx:105`) defeats `React.memo` — severity: **low** — creates a new object every render; acknowledged with FIXME.
- [!] Minimum supported browser version not confirmed — severity: **low** — resolution path: check `excalidraw-app/vite.config.ts` `build.target`; tracked as Q-1 in `docs/product/PRD.md`.

## Milestones

- `Memory Bank setup` — **Done** — All orientation docs created, audited (3 passes), and cross-referenced; AI can onboard to this repo without verbal re-orientation.
- `PRD v0.1` — **Done** — Reverse-engineered PRD of Excalidraw created; In Review status; scope clarification (Q-4) still needed.
- `Doc audit pass` — **Done** (sessions 6–8) — All reference docs verified against source; MD041/MD040 lint fixes applied to memory files.
- `Workshop PR complete` — **Done** — PR opened (2026-03-26); review follow-up fixes applied (commit `90d52b7`).
- `First implementation task` — **Not started** — Scope TBD; no code changed yet.
- `Test coverage baseline` — **Not started** — Run `yarn test:all` to confirm current pass/fail state before any changes.
- `Feature implementation` — **Not started** — Depends on: first task defined, test baseline confirmed.
- `CI green` — **Not started** — All thresholds met: lines 60%, branches 70%, functions 63%, statements 60%.
